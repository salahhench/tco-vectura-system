# Shared Python Tool for Modular Computation and Comparison of the TCO

## Overview

This project, a collaboration between the **Eco4Impact** and **EcoBoatTwin** teams, provides a shared, modular Python tool for the detailed computation and comparative analysis of the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** for transport assets. It is designed to model both **trucks** and **ships**, allowing for a comprehensive financial evaluation of different powertrain technologies and operational scenarios.

The tool is built using the `cosapp` library to create a modular and extensible system. The core principle is to break down the TCO into its three fundamental components:

1.  **CAPEX (Capital Expenditure)**: The initial investment cost.
2.  **OPEX (Operational Expenditure)**: The annual running costs.
3.  **RV (Residual Value)**: The asset's value at the end of its operational life.

## TCO Framework Components

The calculation is broken down into the following detailed modules, as specified in the project report.

### 1. CAPEX (Capital Expenditure)
Calculated by `capex_calculator.py`, this module computes the upfront investment costs. It includes:
- **Vehicle Cost**: Purchase price for new or used assets, plus any conversion/retrofit costs.
- **Infrastructure Cost**: Hardware, software, grid connection, installation, and licensing.
- **Financials**: Taxes, subsidies, and financing costs (Capital Recovery Factor).

### 2. OPEX (Operational Expenditure)
Calculated by `Opex_Calculator_trucks.py` and `Opex_Calculator_ships.py`, this module determines the annual costs required to operate the asset. Key components include:
- **Energy**: Fuel or electricity costs based on consumption.
- **Taxes, Tolls & Ports**: Annual circulation taxes, road tolls (trucks), and port fees (ships).
- **Insurance**: Annual insurance premiums, dependent on vehicle type and value.
- **Crew**: Wages for drivers or ship crew members.
- **Maintenance**: Annual maintenance and repair costs.

### 3. RV (Residual Value)
Calculated by `rv_functions.py`, this module estimates the asset's market value at the end of the analysis period. The calculation is based on:
- **Depreciation**: Value loss from age, usage (km or hours), and maintenance investment.
- **Technical Health**: A penalty factor accounting for powertrain efficiency, technological obsolescence, remaining warranty, and battery degradation from charging behavior.
- **External Factors**: Market adjustments based on projected energy prices, CO2 taxes, and subsidies.

## System Architecture

The project's architecture is designed for modularity, consistency, and scalability, with `cosapp` as its core framework. It is built upon a **"Single Source of Truth"** principle to ensure that all calculation modules operate on identical data.

### 1. The Unified Vehicle Port

All vehicle input parameters (e.g., power, cost, weight, energy type) are centralized in a single, unified `cosapp` Port:

- **File:** `models/vehicle_port.py`
- **Class:** `VehiclePropertiesPort`

This approach is critical for maintaining data integrity. It prevents the duplication of variables across different modules (CAPEX, OPEX, RV) and ensures that any change to a vehicle parameter is made in only one place.

**Rule:** No file outside of `models/vehicle_port.py` should ever define or duplicate vehicle properties. All modules must source this information from the port.

### 2. Integrating the Port into Calculation Modules

Any `cosapp` System that requires vehicle parameters (such as the calculators for CAPEX, OPEX, or RV) **must** follow this standard pattern:

1.  **Import the Port:** The module must import `VehiclePropertiesPort`.
2.  **Declare as Input:** In its `setup()` method, the system must declare the port as a managed input.
3.  **Access Data:** All vehicle-related variables must be accessed through the port.

**Standard Implementation Example:**

```python
from models.vehicle_port import VehiclePropertiesPort

class MyCalculator(System):
    def setup(self):
        # Add the unified port as an input
        self.add_input(VehiclePropertiesPort, 'in_vehicle_properties')

    def compute(self):
        # Access vehicle data from the port
        vp = self.in_vehicle_properties
        cost = vp.purchase_cost
        country = vp.registration_country
```

This standardized integration guarantees that every component in the system shares the exact same vehicle characteristics. All variable names must correspond exactly to those defined in `vehicle_port.py`.

### 3. Main Orchestrator and Data Flow

-   **Orchestrator:** `main_tco.py` is the main entry point of the application. It assembles the complete TCO model by connecting the `VehiclePropertiesPort` to the various calculation systems (CAPEX, OPEX, RV). It is responsible for setting the initial vehicle data, running the simulation, and aggregating the final results.

-   **JSON Database:** The tool is highly data-driven. Non-vehicle parameters—such as country-specific tax rates, subsidies, crew wages, or infrastructure costs—are loaded from external JSON files located in the `database/` directory (`db_trucks.json`, `db_ships.json`). This design separates core logic from configuration data, allowing for easy updates and scenario modeling without altering the Python code.

## How to Run the Project

To run a complete TCO analysis, ensure all dependencies are installed and execute the main orchestrator from your terminal:

```bash
python main_tco.py
```

This command will run the scenarios pre-defined in the script (e.g., a diesel truck in France and a cargo ship in Spain). It will print a detailed breakdown of the CAPEX, OPEX, and RV results, followed by the final TCO summary for each case.
